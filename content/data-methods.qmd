## Elk River Watershed Habitat and Barrier Maps {-}

High-resolution PDF maps of the Elk River watershed and model results can be accessed here. The watershed is divided into multiple map sheets to allow for detailed examination of modelled habitat and priority barriers identified through this planning process. The locations of WCRP priority barriers and associated map sheet numbers are shown below. In each individual map sheet, priority barriers are symbolized using the following notation: ![label](images/priority-crossing-label.png)

## Connectivity Status Assessment Methods {-}

The connectivity status assessment for Westslope Cutthroat Trout in the Elk River watershed builds on existing connectivity modelling work undertaken by the BC Fish Passage Technical Working Group, resulting in a flexible, customizable open-source spatial model called "bcfishpass". The model spatially locates known and modelled barriers to fish passage, identifies potential spawning and rearing habitat for Westslope Cutthroat Trout, and estimates the amount of habitat that is currently accessible as part of the Longest Fragment for each WCRP unit. The Longest Fragment approach is adapted from @Diaz2021 and is calculated as the ratio between the length of largest connected set of habitat patches and the total length of all habitat patches in each WCRP unit. In the Elk River watershed, the longest fragment represents the mainstem Elk River and all currently connected tributaries, both upstream and downstream of the Elko Dam. As such, meeting the connectivity goals set in this plan requires prioritizing barriers for remediation that will reconnect tributaries to the existing longest fragments see [barrier prioritzation](barrier-prioritization.qmd).

The model uses an adapted version of the Intrinsic Potential (IP) fish habitat modelling framework (see @Sheer2009-kb for an overview of the IP framework). The habitat model uses two geomorphic characteristics of the stream network — channel gradient and mean annual discharge — to identify potential spawning habitat and rearing habitat for target species. For the purposes of this plan, rearing habitat is used as an umbrella term to capture the requirements for Westslope Cutthroat Trout rearing, maintenance, and overwintering habitat. The habitat model does not attempt to definitively map each habitat type nor estimate habitat quality, but rather identifies stream segments that have high potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for Westslope Cutthroat Trout based on the geomorphic characteristics of the segment. For more details on the connectivity and habitat model structure and parameters, please see @Mazany-Wright2021-rz. The variables and thresholds used to model potential spawning and rearing habitat are summarized below. The quantity of modelled habitat was aggregated for each habitat type to inform the two KEAs — Accessible Habitat Upstream of Elko Dam and Accessible Habitat Downstream of Elko Dam — and represents a linear measure of potential habitat. To recognize the rearing value provided by features represented by polygons (e.g., lakes for overwintering) a multiplier of 1.5x the length of the stream segments flowing through the polygons was applied.
