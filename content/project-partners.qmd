## Project Partners {-}

## Planning Team {-}

The Ktunaxa National Council (KNC) was invited to participate in the planning process, but was unable to at this time. CWF desires to collaborate with KNC on this plan in the future, and the planning team has tried to reflect our understanding of the rights and values of the Ktunaxa people in this WCRP. We are committed to correcting any errors in assumption or interpretation that are identified in this plan.
