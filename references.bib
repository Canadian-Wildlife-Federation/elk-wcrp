  author    = "Burnett, Kelly M and Reeves, Gordon H and Miller, Daniel J and
               Clarke, Sharon and Vance-Borland, Ken and Christiansen, Kelly",
  abstract  = "The geographic distribution of stream reaches with potential to
               support high-quality habitat for salmonids has bearing on the
               actual status of habitats and populations over broad spatial
               extents. As part of the Coastal Landscape Analysis and Modeling
               Study (CLAMS), we examined how salmon-habitat potential was
               distributed relative to current and future (+100 years)
               landscape characteristics in the Coastal Province of Oregon,
               USA. The intrinsic potential to provide high-quality rearing
               habitat was modeled for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus
               kisutch) and juvenile steelhead (O. mykiss) based on stream
               flow, valley constraint, and stream gradient. Land ownership,
               use, and cover were summarized for 100-m analysis buffers on
               either side of stream reaches with high intrinsic potential and
               in the overall area encompassing the buffers. Past management
               seems to have concentrated nonindustrial private ownership,
               agriculture, and developed uses adjacent to reaches with high
               intrinsic potential for coho salmon. Thus, of the area in coho
               salmon buffers, 45\% is either nonforested or recently logged,
               but only 10\% is in larger-diameter forests. For the area in
               steelhead buffers, 21\% is either non-forested or recently
               logged while 20\% is in larger-diameter forests. Older forests
               are most extensive on federal lands but are rare on private
               lands, highlighting the critical role for public lands in
               near-term salmon conservation. Agriculture and development are
               projected to remain focused near high-intrinsic-potential
               reaches for coho salmon, increasing the importance of
               effectively addressing nonpoint source pollution from these
               uses. Percentages of larger-diameter forests are expected to
               increase throughout the province, but the increase will be only
               half as much in coho salmon buffers as in steelhead buffers.
               Most of the increase is projected for public lands, where
               policies emphasize biodiversity protection. Results suggest that
               widespread recovery of coho salmon is unlikely unless habitat
               can be improved in high-intrinsic-potential reaches on private
               lands. Knowing where high-intrinsic-potential stream reaches
               occur relative to landscape characteristics can help in
               evaluating the current and future condition of freshwater
               habitat, explaining differences between species in population
               status and risk, and assessing the need for and feasibility of

               juvenile anadromous coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus
               clarki) and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were evaluated
               using survey data from 119 sites in coastal British Columbia.
               Both cutthroat and coho occurred at their highest densities in
               very small streams (2 = 0.55). Within a channel, densities of
               coho and larger (yearling and older) cutthroat parr were highest
               in pools, while densities of young-of-the-year cutthroat were
               significantly lower in pools and highest in shallower habitats.
               Abundance of larger cutthroat parr and pool habitat were
               positively correlated with large woody debris (LWD) within a
               subset of intermediate-gradient gravel-cobble streams, where
               pools appear to be limiting to larger cutthroat parr abundance.
               More than 50\% of pools were formed by scour associated with LWD
               in streams ranging from 1.2 to 11 m channel width, and pools
               formed by LWD scour were on average 10\% deeper than pools
               formed by other mechanisms. Disproportionate use of small
               streams by cutthroat indicates that protection of small stream
